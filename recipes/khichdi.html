<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    This hodge podge recipe was passed down from my great-grandmother in 1889, who shared it in 1906 with my grandmother, the only daughter of 17 boys. Both women said, "This meal feeds the soul." For me, the recipe allows for no substitutions. The whole allure of the dish is the rich dimensional taste and fresh flavors of the summer harvest! This version might satisfy others who are looking for great flavor in hodge podge food.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>6 slices bacon</li>
    <li>6 tablespoons butter, divided</li>        
    <li>1 small onion, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>1 small garlic clove, peeled but left whole</li>
    <li>1 cup trimmed and snapped fresh green beans</li>
    <li>1 cup trimmed and snapped fresh wax beans</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups baby carrots</li>
    <li>1 cup low-sodium chicken broth</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water, or as needed (Optional)</li>
    <li>salt to taste</li>
    <li>12 small whole new potatoes</li>
    <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>½ cup water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Cook bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate, then crumble and set aside</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic; cook and stir until garlic has softened and onion begins to turn golden brown, about 8 minutes. Scrape mixture into a small bowl. Remove garlic clove, mash, and return to the bowl.</li>
    <li>Place beans and carrots into the same pot. Pour in chicken broth and enough water to just cover the vegetables; season with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in potatoes and cook until tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in garlic-onion mixture, cream, and remaining 4 tablespoons butter; return to a simmer.</li>
    <li>Dissolve flour in 1/2 cup water and stir into the soup. Cook and stir until soup has thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve with crumbled bacon.</li>
